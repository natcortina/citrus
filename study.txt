    - Feeling: “Feelings are subjective, longer-lasting experiences that arise from our interpretation and understanding of emotions. They derive FROM emotions.”
            - feelings: Anxiety, Terror, Depression , Happiness , Confusion, Nauseated 

Duration
    - Emotion - short “sad”
    - Feeling  - long  “depressed”

Variety:
    - Emotions are universal 
    - Feelings can be very personal 

Changes in the body:
